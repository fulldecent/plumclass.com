## Introduction

At the heart of our mission lies the well-being of infants and children. We understand the critical role healthcare facilities, like yours, play in caring for the pediatric population. To ensure the highest standards of care, it is essential that your personnel are certified in Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS).

Within your healthcare setting, you have a diverse group of providers. Some are dedicated to the daily care of critically ill children, while others tend to those with less severe injuries or illnesses, always ready to respond swiftly to changing circumstances. These distinct groups have varying educational requirements, yet the current approach offers a single course for all providers.

We've revolutionized this approach by offering an online PALS certification program designed to accommodate the diversity of our participants. This course delivers in-depth education to those in need, while also providing a comprehensive review of the latest developments in pediatric medicine for those practicing critical care regularly. No two providers will follow the same path or timeline, but all will emerge with the ability to demonstrate their competence through a successful online examination. Our course not only meets the needs of individual participants but also aligns with your administrative requirements.

## Course Formats

Our PALS certification course is available in two formats: in-person group sessions and an online/blended format. All our instructors are certified with current and valid ACLS/PALS instructor credentials from the American Heart Association. (In some cases, customers may require our instructors to hold paramedic licensure, which we can accommodate.)

This course is suitable for mandatory job training.

## Skill Assessment

For those whose employers mandate an in-person skills test, we provide a Pacific Medical Training skills test form accessible in your student workroom for printing. A certified authorized instructor, such as a paramedic, can administer your skills test. Following your successful completion of the in-person skills test, the instructor will complete the form. Please note that the instructor does not issue a new eCard; your Pacific Medical Training eCard was immediately provided upon completion of our online course. If requested, hard-copy certificates can be shipped. Simply email your completed skills test form, along with your instructor's credential information, to [support@PacificMedicalTraining.com](mailto:support@PacificMedicalTraining.com). If you encounter difficulty locating an instructor, reach out to us, and we will assist in finding one in your area.

It's worth noting that our skills check documentation process is considerably more rigorous compared to the American Heart Association, Red Cross, and other brands.
